# Data-structure-and-algorothm
### We need to have the following drivers installed in our machine:
  * For java : [Oracle Downloads Page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
  * For C & C++: [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds)


### Implementierung von DSA mit Java

* Runing Java file in Command Prompt
 
  - Naviagte to the directory
  - run `java --version` to check if JRE is already installed. In case of successful install one can expect to see like &#8595;
```
   C:\Users\yourpcname>java --version
   java 16.0.1 2021-04-20
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 16.0.1+9-24)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0.1+9-24, mixed mode, sharing)
```
  - Create a java file with same name as the class name
  - run `javac sample.java` command
  - run `java sample`




### Implementierung von DSA mit C++ und C
* Running C++ and C file in the command Prompt
  - Navigate to the directory
  - run `g++ --version` to see if C++ code runner is already installd or not
  - run `gcc --version` to see if C++ code runner is already installd or not
* In case of successful install one can expect to see like &#8595;
```
C:\Users\yourpcname>gcc --version
gcc (i686-posix-dwarf-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 8.1.0

C:\Users\yourpcname>g++ --version

```
  - run '_g++ sample.cpp -o sample.exe_' to create a .exe object in the directory for .cpp file or
  - run '_g++ sample.c -o sample.exe_' to create a .exe object in the directory for .c file
  - then run 'sample.exe'
  - Before these steps you need to install either 'mingw-w64' or 'cygwin64' and you also have to set the environmental variable as a path

* Now we can go to our Directory in the local machine and can practice the DSAs given in the `dsa.md` file
* Command Prompt or Git Bash can be used to execute the commands
